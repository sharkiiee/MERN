## useMemo()

1. In this assignment, your task is to create a component that performs an expensive calculation (finding the factorial) based on a user input.
   - Use useMemo to ensure that the calculation is only recomputed when the input changes, not on every render.
2. In this assignment, you will create a component that renders a large list of sentences and includes an input field for filtering these items.

   - The goal is to use useMemo to optimize the filtering process, ensuring the list is only re-calculated when necessary (e.g., when the filter criteria changes).
   - You will learn something new here, specifically how you have to pass more than one value in the dependency array

3. You have been given a list of items you shopped from the grocery store
   - You need to calculate the total amount of money you spent
