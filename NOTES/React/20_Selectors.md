## Selectors

In Recoil, selectors are functions that derive new pieces of state from existing ones. They allow you to compute derived state based on the values of atoms or other selectors. Selectors are an essential part of managing complex state logic in a Recoil application.

Here are some key concepts related to selectors:

### 1] **Creating a Selector:**

- You can create a selector using the `selector` function from Recoil.

- Example:

```import { selector } from 'recoil';

const doubledCountSelector = selector({
  key: 'doubledCount',
  get: ({ get }) => {
    const count = get(countState);
    return count * 2;
  },
});
```

### 2] **Using Selectors in Components:**

- You can use selectors in your components using the `useRecoilValue` hook.

- Example:
```import { useRecoilValue } from 'recoil';

const DoubledCountComponent = () => {
  const doubledCount = useRecoilValue(doubledCountSelector);

  return <div>Doubled Count: {doubledCount}</div>;
};
```

### 3] **Atom and Selector Composition:**

- Selectors can depend on atoms or other selectors, allowing you to compose more complex state logic.

- Example:
```const totalSelector = selector({
  key: 'total',
  get: ({ get }) => {
    const count = get(countState);
    const doubledCount = get(doubledCountSelector);
    return count + doubledCount;
  },
});
```

Selectors provide a powerful way to manage derived state in a Recoil application, making it easy to compute and consume state values based on the current state of your atoms.
