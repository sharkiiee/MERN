<!-- 
    Debouncing:

Delays the execution of a function until after a pause in events.
Ensures that the function is not called repeatedly in a short period of time.
Sets a timer on event occurrence, resets it on subsequent events, and executes the function only after a specified delay with no new events.
Useful for scenarios like auto-saving, filtering search results, and handling scroll events.

    Throttling:

Limits the frequency of function execution regardless of event frequency.
Ensures that the function is not called more than once in a specified time interval.
Allows the function to be executed at most once during the specified interval, ignoring subsequent events within that interval.
Useful for scenarios like window resizing, handling mouse move events, and rate limiting API requests.
