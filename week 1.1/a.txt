1.Synchronous functtion:-

-Doing something one after the another or one by one or one thing at a time is what Synchronous means.

2.Asynchronous function:-

-Things are happening in parts or parallely.
-Multiple things are context switching with each other.


How Asynchronous works even when javascript is single threaded:-
Example- Human brain and body is single threaded
1.As a human we can do one thing at a time.
2.But we can context switch between task , or we delegate task to other people.

Context Switching:-
Whenever we find free time or we prioritise that works like-
chopping vegetables while water is boiling , we are not waiting for water to boil then to cut vegetables this is called context switching.
